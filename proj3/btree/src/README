Comments:
	1.Overall description of your algorithms and data structures
	We put the corresponding algorithms and data structures in buf.h and the head of source code: btleafpage.C,btindexpage.C, btfile.C key.C, sorted_page.C btreefilescan.C

	2.Anything unusual in your implementation
	We put the corresponding unusual implementations in the head of corresponding source code:btleafpage.C,btindexpage.C, btfile.C key.C, sorted_page.C btreefilescan.C

	3.What functionalities not supported well
   	All functions are supported well.
	-----------------------------------------------

All the files in this directory:

Makefile: a sample makefile

btfile.C, btindex_page.C, btleaf_page.C, btreefilescan.C:
you need to write these .C files and their corresponding .h files in ../include.

buf.C: This has empty body. You can replace this file with your buffer manager used for project 2.

main.C, btree_driver.C, keys: these are the test driver

sorted_page.C: You also need to implement this.

hfpage.C: This has empty body. You can replace this file with your hfpage used for project 1.

Other .C files: They are same as ones used in projects 1 and 2.

expected_output: results of running the test driver using a correct implementation

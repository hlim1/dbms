Comments:
	1.Overall description of your algorithms and data structures
	We put the corresponding algorithms and data structures in the head of source code: buf.C, hfpage.C, scan.C, heapfile.C

	2.Anything unusual in your implementation
	We put the corresponding unusual implementations in the head of corresponding source code:
	hfpage.C, scan.C, heapfile.C

	3.What functionalities not supported well
	All functionalities are fully supported.

*** Some important files you should know ***

Makefile: a sample makefile to compile your project; this will generate an executable, named 'heaptest'. 

expected_output: an expected output from a correct implementation when heaptest is successfully finished

../include/scan.h: specifications for the Scan class.
	    ( Note: we do not expect you to change this file. )

../include/heapfile.h: specifications for the HeapFile class.
	    ( Note: we do not expect you to change this file. )

../include/hfpage.h: specifications for the HFPage class.
	    ( Note: we do not expect you to change this file. )

heapfile.C: the skeleton of the implementation of the HeapFile class.
	    ( Note: You should implement this. )

scan.C: the skeleton of the implementation of the Scan class.
	    ( Note: You should implement this. )

hfpage.C: the skeleton of the implementation of the HFPage class.
	    ( Note: You may want to replace this with your hfpage.C in HFPage.)

main.C, test_driver.C, heap_driver.C: the testing programs.
